# VBA-challenge
This is a project for the Northwestern University Data Science & Visualization Bootcamp. 
This project was created by Joseph DeVito, with collaboration from Corbin Moore.
In this project, I developed skills in VBA scripting in Microsoft Excel through working with large amounts of stock data. 
This project tested my ability to retrieve data, create columns, apply conditional formatting, calculate and display values, and apply looping across various worksheets--All using VBA scripting. 
I feel confident that this project has established me as a budding Excel expert and a proficient programmer using VBA script in Excel.
